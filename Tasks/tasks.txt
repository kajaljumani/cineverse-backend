YOUR OBJECTIVES
1. API-FIRST DESIGN

Implement a clean, versioned REST API

Mobile app consumes only our backend, never TMDB directly

Use Laravel best practices (Form Requests, Resources, Policies)

2. CORE FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT
A. Authentication

JWT or Laravel Sanctum

Login / Register / Logout

Fetch & update profile

B. User Preferences

Create APIs to:

Save onboarding preferences

Update preferences later

Fetch preferences

Preferences include:

Genres (array)

Languages (array)

Streaming providers (array)

Min rating

Release year range

Store as JSON where appropriate.

C. TMDB Integration Layer

Create a dedicated TMDBService

Cache movie/series data locally in DB

Store:

tmdb_id

type (movie / tv)

title

poster_path

backdrop_path

genres

rating

release_date

provider availability (if available)

Never expose TMDB API keys to frontend.

D. Discovery / Feed Engine (CRITICAL)

Implement feed logic that:

Fetches candidate items from local cache

Applies user preference filters

Excludes:

Disliked

Watched

Sorts by:

Preference match score

Rating

Popularity

Returns paginated feed

Include a simple rule-based scoring system (no ML).

E. User Interaction APIs

Track all interactions:

Like

Dislike

Watched

Skipped

Each interaction must:

Be idempotent

Affect future feed results

F. Watchlist APIs

Add to watchlist

Remove from watchlist

Mark as watched

Fetch watchlist (filters supported)

G. Comments (Optional but Implementable)

Add comment on movie/series

Fetch comments (paginated)

Delete own comment

H. Cron Jobs

Daily: fetch trending movies & series

Weekly: refresh ratings

Store results in DB for feed use

DELIVERABLES

You must produce:

Database migrations

Eloquent models & relationships

API routes

Controllers

Services (TMDB, FeedScoring)

Example API responses

Clear inline comments where logic is non-trivial

STRICT RULES

DO NOT rewrite existing unrelated code

DO NOT introduce paid services

DO NOT change mobile UX assumptions

All APIs must be documented via response examples
